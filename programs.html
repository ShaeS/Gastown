    	<p>The Gastown Business Improvement Society (GBIS) is taking a lead role in the revitalization of Vancouver’s premier heritage area. The GBIS is a non-profit organization representing Gastown property owners and business owners.<br/><br/>

The GBIS provides a variety of programs such as safety patrols, maintenance crews, tourism services and serves as an organizer and catalyst for special events and the continuing revitalization of the neighbourhood.<br/><br/>

<span class="bolding">Public Safety</span><br/><br/>

The Gastown Business Improvement Society’s Patrol officers help make Gastown a safe, friendly place to work, shop and enjoy. Gastown patrol officers patrol the Gastown area 7 days a week, year round. They visit street-level retail businesses on their beat; leave a calling card inviting business owners to contact us with problems of any kind. Gastown patrol officers not only help maintain safe streets, they assist visitors and workers by providing directions, walking people to their cars and helping them to find area attractions including restaurants, shops and tourist attractions.<br/><br/>


<span class="bolding">Sanitation</span><br/><br/>

Keeping Gastown streets clean is a major goal of the Gastown Business Improvement Society. The Society hires United We Can to clean the lanes and sidewalks 4 days a week.<br/><br/>


<span class="bolding">Maintenance</span><br/><br/>

Each week we remove hundreds of stickers and illegal advertisements from light poles and other street furniture.<br/><br/>


<span class="bolding">Neighbourhood in Bloom</span><br/><br/>

The Gastown Business Improvement Society installs and maintains over 200 hanging flower baskets in Gastown each summer.<br/><br/>


<span class="bolding">The Gastown Steam Clock</span><br/><br/>

The GBIS along with the city of Vancouver pays for the ongoing maintenance of the beloved Gastown Steam Clock. Based on an 1875 design, the Gastown Steam Clock was the first steam-powered clock in the world.<br/><br/>


<span class="bolding">GBIS Website</span><br/><br/>

The Internet is an invaluable communication tool. We have upgraded the GBIS web site and set up a program that allows us to do quick on-the-spot updates. We are now able to send weekly emails to our members about news and events in Gastown. As well Gastown merchant members now have the ability to update their own information on the GBIS web site. For those merchants that have their own web sites, the GBIS provides a direct link from the GBIS web site to the merchants web site at no cost. For more information on this program, please contact us at: 604-683-5650 or email: info@gastown.org.<br/><br/>


<span class="bolding">Banners</span><br/><br/>

The GBIS installs street banners along Cordova, Carrall and Powell Streets reflecting various Gastown themes or initiatives.<br/><br/>


<span class="bolding">Historic Plaques</span><br/><br/>

The GBIS installed a series of ‘Historic Plaques’ on 23 Gastown buildings. If you follow the Historic Plaque route, you will discover historic clues to the area. The GBIS will be expanding their Historic Plaque Program. If you are interested in sponsoring a plaque on your building, please contact us at: 604-683-5650 or email: info@gastown.org.<br/><br/>
